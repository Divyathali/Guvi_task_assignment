copy by value vs copy by reference
------------------------------------
copy by value: 
1.Deals with actual parameters values.so the varible of the assignment is not affected.
2.the pointers/memory used in seperted address location.
copy by reference: 
1.Deals with actual parameters address.So the varible should be affected in the assignment.
2.The pointers/memory pointout the same address.
