Currently most of the systems used in HTTP 1.1.

HTTP 0.9,1 has a drawback of data handshaking,data loss issues,Data safety,data priority management issues.The previous issues overcome by HTTP1.1.

HTTP 2 has better Encryption/decryption methods for data safety than HTTP 1.1.but it struggles in network congestion issues, so it holds in under development process.

HTTP 2,HTTP 3 is under the development stages.The both HTTP is dealing with Unlimited data transfer and excellent User experiences.

Cause for Development:

    1.Data Loss.
    2.Network congestion.
    3.Network loss and data safety.
    4.UDP packet transfer.
    5.Multiplexing Issues.

HTTP3: Both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 use TCP as their transport. HTTP/3 uses QUIC, a transport layer network protocol developed initially by Google where user space congestion control is used over the UDP. The switch to QUIC aims to fix a major problem of HTTP/2 called “head-of-line blocking”: because the parallel nature of HTTP/2’s multiplexing is not visible to TCP loss recovery mechanisms, a lost or reordered packet causes all active transactions to experience a stall regardless of whether that transaction was impacted by the lost packet. Because QUIC provides native multiplexing, lost packets only impact the streams where data has been lost.
